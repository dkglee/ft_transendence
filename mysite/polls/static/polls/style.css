/* Warning

The {% static %} template tag is not available for
use in static files which arenâ€™t generated by Django,
like your stylesheet. You should always use relative
paths to link your static files between each other,
because then you can change STATIC_URL (used by the
static template tag to generate its URLs) without having
to modify a bunch of paths in your static files as well.
